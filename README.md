# Hey! 👋

I'm a design engineer at the intersection of design systems, frontend, and developer tooling —
focused on the gap between how interfaces are designed and how they're actually built.

Currently:
- ⚙️ making design-to-code workflows more reliable
- 🤖 experimenting with AI coding agents
- 🛠️ building open source tools
