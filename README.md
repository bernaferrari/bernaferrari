### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It is hard to describe myself. I have extensive experience making random things. You won't find two projects that look or work the same in my profile, and I hope that's a good thing for you. :)

Right now, I'm happy working in design to code.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently investigating the bridge between developers and designers.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mobile, web, or anything random.
- ðŸ˜Ž Feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bernaferrari), Reddit or anywhere!
